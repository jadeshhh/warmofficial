  <p id="name"><strong>Mazal</strong></p>
  <p id="first">Mazal is currently sixteen years-old and a rising high school seniors. Her hobbies are reading fiction, writing short stories, and drawing. She has always been interested in pursuing a career in STEM, specifically medicine; however, she chose to do Girls Who Code to expand her interests and now is considering a career in biomedical engineering due to how much she enjoys coding. </p>
  <p id="second">Mazal has always felt the importance of mental health issues. She feels that something as widespread as this should not be stigmatized nor ignored. Many people that she knows suffer from some mental health issues and refuse to get help because they are worried about others hearing about it. This is why she felt that this game would be important: it's bringing awareness, it's normalizing this issue. </p>

            Kim Swift is a computer programer who frequently works as a game designer. She was a major inspiration for us and for our game because she makes intriguing stories to go with the games she is designing. In addition, she usually uses subtle messages in her games to show different issues in societies including mental health issues which was one of the elements of the game we were aiming for. Also within her games she has outstanding quality whether it may be the graphics, animations or the storyline which is very admirable. Some of these games include Left 4 Dead, Left 4 Dead 2, Portal, Half-Life, and others which were big among the gaming community and are still frequently talked about and played despite being some of the older games.

            Kim was born in 1983 and currently lives in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. She has worked at various big corporations like Amazon and at EA (Electronic Arts) where she currently works. Some of her accomplishments and awards was getting named one of Fortune’s “30 under 30”.

            In a Q&A she said that ambiguity is extremely important to her in her games, giving hints to a hidden underlying message that is general enough to allow room for different interpretations by the gamers. We all thrive to create games and use our coding expertise to make a career for ourselves in computer science, just as Swift does currently.
