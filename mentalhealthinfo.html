          Mental health is an important issue in society today due to how common mental health issues truly are. According to MentalHealth.org, “one in five American adults experienced a mental health issue, one in 10 young people experienced a period of major depression, one in 20 Americans lived with a serious mental illness, such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, or major depression”. Two of the most common mental health issues are mood disorders like depression and anxiety disorders like obsessive compulsive disorder, according to Pine Rest.

        <p id="bruh2">
          According to the World Health Organization, also known as the WHO, mental health is "a state of well-being in which the individual realizes his or her own abilities, can cope with the normal stresses of life, can work productively and fruitfully, and is able to make a contribution to his or her community." The Mayo Clinic classifies mental health disorders as “disorders that affect your mood, thinking and behavior”.

        <p id="bruh3">
          Mental health is under-represented today; youth mental health is worsening, with 76% of youth not receiving any treatment or enough treatment. There remains a stigma concerning mental health issues and disorders. Some of those who suffer from mental health issues have an encompassing feeling of shame and fear to seek help. These feelings restrain the person from achieving a full recovery. Ridding the world of this stigma can allow many more to successfully get through their struggles. Pine Rest explains that this stigma originates from media stereotypes and lack of education and these are also reasons why the stigma has not yet faded. By showing respect and acceptance towards those affected, raising awareness, and educating yourself about mental health, you can contribute to the end of the stigma.
        </p>
        <p id="bruh4">
          There are four important aspects to recovery according to Mentalhealth.org: making healthy decisions that support their wellbeing, a safe and stable home, having a purpose--whether engaging in community activities or having a job--and building relationships with others.
