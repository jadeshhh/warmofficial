            Kim Swift is a computer programer who frequently works as a game designer. She was a major inspiration for us and for our game because she makes intriguing stories to go with the games she is designing. In addition, she usually uses subtle messages in her games to show different issues in societies including mental health issues which was one of the elements of the game we were aiming for. Also within her games she has outstanding quality whether it may be the graphics, animations or the storyline which is very admirable. Some of these games include Left 4 Dead, Left 4 Dead 2, Portal, Half-Life, and others which were big among the gaming community and are still frequently talked about and played despite being some of the older games.

            Kim was born in 1983 and currently lives in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. She has worked at various big corporations like Amazon and at EA (Electronic Arts) where she currently works. Some of her accomplishments and awards was getting named one of Fortune’s “30 under 30”.

            In a Q&A she said that ambiguity is extremely important to her in her games, giving hints to a hidden underlying message that is general enough to allow room for different interpretations by the gamers. We all thrive to create games and use our coding expertise to make a career for ourselves in computer science, just as Swift does currently.
